1. Why do you want to learn data science?

I want to learn data science because I have worked in the past with scraping data, tidying it up and visualising it. I felt like I could have a better theoretical understanding to improve my workflow as my previous process felt too complicated und not streamlined enough.
I also like working with OpenData and gaining the skills to give meaning to datasets, seems important ot me.

2. What course topics are you especially interested in?

I am really interested in tidying data up and how to visualise data.

3. Describe your own programming skills (languages, technologies, Python in particular)

I used Python as my starting point for my programming learning path. From creating a simple pygame to writing multiple scraping scripts with Scrapy to creating a API's with Flask and FastAPI (main focus the past semesters).
I have no experience with python used in Data science.
Other programming skills include React.js, Next.js, Typescript, React Native.

5. How do you plan to learn?

As I have already selected all my modules for my B.Sc. I am taking this LU as a "Fun LU" meaning I will participate in as many LU's as my schedule allows and will try to do as many assignments (e.g. mini projects) as possible.

6. Do you have a favorite data analysis, graphic or data presentation? Which one?

As I am new to this topic, I so far don't have any favourite tools.
